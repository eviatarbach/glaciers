# Code for "How sensitive are mountain glaciers to climate change? Insights from a block model"

This repository contains the code for the paper "How sensitive are mountain glaciers to climate change? Insights from a block model" by Eviatar Bach, Valentina Radić, and Christian Schoof, 2017, to be published in the *Journal of Glaciology*.

The code is for computing response times and sensitivity to equilibrium line altitude (ELA) changes for mountain glaciers worldwide, using a block model with volume–area–length scaling and a piecewise linear mass balance profile.
